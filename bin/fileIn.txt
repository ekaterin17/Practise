The Boscombe Valley Mystery
We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:

ÒHave you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11.15.Ó

ÒWhat do you say, dear?Ó said my wife, looking across at me. ÒWill you go?Ó

ÒI really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.Ó

ÒOh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases.Ó

ÒI should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,Ó I answered. ÒBut if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.Ó
